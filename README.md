# GreekGlyphScribe

Math Symbol Identifier is a Deep Learning (DL) project designed to assist students in learning new mathematical symbols. When students encounter unfamiliar Greek symbols in their mathematical studies, they can visit this website, draw the symbol on the canvas, and receive basic information about the symbol, predicted by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
